# BearcatLanding
As a part of UC's UI course--we are redesigning a 'bad' user interface in which we decided on the UC landing portal page

Why the landing page? A great article to figure out why (other than it being not personal to students needs) check out this article by Harry Albert at The Williams Record.

Albert makes a great point that a lot of these websites look like they were created during the beginning of the Dot Com Bubble and have not been updated since! Although the UC's landing page 
has been updated--it is still clunky with its organisation and moderate cleanliness. Most colleges spend absorbant amounts of money to run and host these pages to make sure they are secure 
and functional for the students--but at what cost for the user? Is the college truly spending their money in the best way if the user cannot properly navigate the pages?

GeeksforGeeks has a great article on why UI is important. See it at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/websites-apps/importance-of-ui-ux-design/
As well as the company that hosts the UC page, Modo, claims that their product improves work time (time being lost to not understanding applications), millions of dollars saved from
being lost in prodoctivity, and absorbant ROIs. Both GeeksforGeeks and Modo get this both right--having a page with good UI saves the user not only from headaches but gains trust in the user
as well as the company. This saves a lot of confusion for students to ask professors or IT staff that may not understand what they are asking or why they do not get what they are doing. 
Making sure that a UI is easy to read, intuitive can save a lot of time and money for both the college and for its students.

Current Issues:
-There is lots of redundency, same actions 2-3 times on the same page
-Extra buttons that are often highlighted as 'useful' or 'quick access' but takes up more space on the page
-Does not highlight the important features that one would quick need to access ie canvas, catalyst (our scheduling system), and so on

This is the starting landing page--highlighting finances, daily schedule, among many buttons that simply go unused with a lot of wasted space

A hamburger menu in which I have never used before! Lots and lots of more features highlighting the same information we saw previously on the landing page

Side menu which I needed to show--these features aren't even implemented! They are simply buttons to external links

Finally, the bottom and the only critical section of the page. Ask any UC student and 98% of the time they will say they scoll to the bottom of the page to access these features

Some things we want to do:
-Highlight Canvas, Catalyst, and some of the other features at the bottom of the page and move them up
-Make tabs for Schedule, main page, and finances
-Re work the hamburger menu for better information (pertaining to the college of engineering in this example but more college based as well as your ciriculum)
-Group buttons by common points wheter it be the type of resouce, when it is typically used, something to mesh everything together
-Use your Canvas picture (if any) rather than your Bearcat ID picture which tramatised many of their freshman selves

Initial Sketch of Landing Page:

-Keeps the same feel as it is now
-Highlights the features we need most
-Leaves space for it to be modified
